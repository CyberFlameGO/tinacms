The **User** section of the Tina Cloud dashboard allows external users to be invited to the Tina Cloud dashboard. Within each project, there is a **Collaborators'** tab. Adding an editor as a collaborator grants them authorization to edit directly on that Tina configured site. This allows you to organize and grant editors access on a per-project basis. All admins will have access to all projects by default so they do not need to be set up as collaborators.

> When a site is configured to use Tina Cloud, an authorized user will be prompted for their Tina Cloud credentials to access the editing route of the site.

## Admins vs Editors

When creating a new user in the dashboard, the permission section will require a role selection for the user.

There are currently two roles for Tina Cloud users:

### Admin

An **Admin** has complete access to the Tina Cloud dashboard. This user can add, edit and delete Tina Cloud projects. This user can also setup additional user accounts, edit existing user accounts and setup collaborators. Admins also have access to edit on any specific project and do not need to be setup as collaborators.

### Editor

An **Editor** can login to the Tina Cloud dashboard, but is only authorized to view the sites that they are listed as collaborators for.

Both Admins and Editors are authorized to access the editing route on a Tina configured site. Both users can save content changes directly to a site's GitHub repository using TinaCMS.
