# Markdown Kitchen Sink
This file is https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet plus a few fixes and additions. Used by [obedm503/bootmark](https://github.com/obedm503/bootmark) to [demonstrate](https://obedm503.github.io/bootmark/docs/markdown-cheatsheet.html) it's styling features.

This is intended as a quick reference and showcase. For more complete info, see [John Gruber's original spec](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) and the [Github-flavored Markdown info page](http://github.github.com/github-flavored-markdown/).

Note that there is also a [Cheatsheet specific to Markdown Here](./Markdown-Here-Cheatsheet) if that's what you're looking for. You can also check out [more Markdown tools](./Other-Markdown-Tools).
